# mySQL-Connector-Python_demo
In this project, I used Python to analyze a data from a database. The RDBMS in this instance was mySQL and I was able to access it with python using a connector.
Jupyter was used as the "IDE" and I created a successful connection to answer the following questions:
1. How much is the total donation?
2. What is the total donation by Gender?
3. Show the total donation and number of donations by Gender
4. Total donation made by frequency of donation
5. Total donation and number of donation by Job field
6. Total donation and number of donations above 200USD
7. Total donation and number of donations below 200USD
8. Which top 10 states contributes the highest donations
9. Which top 10 states contributes the least donations
